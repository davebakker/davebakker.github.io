        <p>
          Hi, I'm Dave. In the year twenty-twenty I graduated from Mediacollege in Amsterdam with a degree in media- and game development.
          From the beginning of things, I've had a passion for games, graphics, simulations, experiences, and game engines in particular.
          In my free time, I love to work on/with code or play games. Besides that, I love to cook.
          This also goes well with the fact that introduced a plant-based ethic into my life.
          The reason I decided to study software engineering is that I wish to continue in the direction of the future.
          I also want to broaden my knowledge, establish a career in software engineering, and make dreams a reality.
